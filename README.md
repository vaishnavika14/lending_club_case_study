## Conclusions
When the income increases reduces the loan defaulters .And  loan defaulters are observed with low income , 

Charged off loans increases when the applicant has prior bankruptcy 

The loans for small business almost 26% are charged off and become risky 

Approx 75% of the total loans are given for duration of 3 years and other 25% of the loans are those given for 5 years. The charged off for term 1 year  is 45%  so the higher tenure of loan lesser chance of charged off 

Percentage of charged off loans increases substantially as the loan amount increases.Higher loan  has a risk of defaulters
